# String-it!

String-it App is a Rails backend - React/Redux frontend. This app helps tennis stores keep track of tennis racket stringing orders and notify customers when rackets are ready. The store administrator can add new rackets and strings to their database. Customers can also login to compare previous racket stringing orders and improve their game on the court.

# Features

+ Table data organization using React Table and can easily sort orders by date, customer, order status, order number, and more.
+ Store admins can easily edit orders such as adding or removing racket to orders or editing string tensions for already added rackets.
+ When an order status is changed to "Ready" an automated email is sent to the customer letting him/her know that the racket is ready for pickup.
+ A real-time seach for customers makes it easier to start orders for existing customers.
+ Store admins can also edit customer information from either their profile, an existing order or while creating a new order.
